### Deep Cross Network and Deep Factorization Machines for movie rating prediction


In this project, we have done comparative analysis of
various rating prediction methods on MovieLens100k[1]
dataset. 

Initially, extensive Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA) is done to visualise feature distributions and pick
informative characteristics for implementation. 

While implementing, we have considered DeepFM, Deep &
Cross Networks (DCNs) with stacked, parallel architecture
along with Low-rank techniques and Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs). Furthermore, variations to RMSE for
each model based on different values for hyperparameters
are visualised.
